Multiple Disease Prediction Web App

Introduction:

Welcome to this technical report detailing the development of the "Multiple Disease Prediction" web application. In this project, 
I have combined three distinct disease prediction models for heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes into a unified system. 
Leveraging logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms, I achieved high accuracy rates on each project. 
Through the integration of these models and the utilization of Streamlit and Python, I created a user-friendly web app that empowers individuals 
to assess their health risks comprehensively and make informed decisions.


1. Heart Disease Prediction:
For the heart disease prediction component, I employed logistic regression. I sourced a well-curated dataset from Kaggle, containing relevant medical features.
After thorough analysis and feature engineering, I achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 85%. The logistic regression model has been trained to identify various
risk factors associated with heart disease, enabling early detection and proactive intervention.

2. Parkinson's Disease Prediction:
In my pursuit of predicting Parkinson's disease, I utilized a similar approach. By applying logistic regression to a high-quality Kaggle dataset, I achieved
an accuracy rate of 90%. The model was trained to recognize specific features and symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease, empowering individuals and healthcare
professionals to identify potential cases early on and provide appropriate treatment.

3. Diabetes Prediction:
Taking a different path, I approached diabetes prediction as a regression problem. Employing the robust support vector machine (SVM) algorithm,
I utilized a carefully curated Kaggle dataset to train the model. The SVM model achieved an accuracy rate of 77%, allowing users to assess their risk of
developing diabetes based on various health indicators and lifestyle factors.

Integration and Web App Development:

To combine these three disease prediction models into a single web application, I employed the Streamlit framework in Python. Streamlit provided an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their health data and receive comprehensive predictions for multiple diseases. The seamless integration of the models ensured efficient processing and real-time results.

User Interface and Experience:
The "Multiple Disease Prediction" web app offers a visually appealing and intuitive user interface. Users can input their relevant health data, such as age, blood pressure,
cholesterol levels, and other necessary parameters. The app processes this information through integrated models and presents the predictions for heart disease, Parkinson's
disease, and diabetes. The results are displayed in a user-friendly format, providing insights into potential risk factors and highlighting areas that require attention.

Conclusion:
The development of the "Multiple Disease Prediction" web application demonstrates the successful integration of logistic regression and support vector machine algorithms 
for predicting heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. By combining these models, I have created a powerful tool that empowers individuals to assess their health 
risks comprehensively. The user-friendly interface and accurate predictions make this web app a valuable resource for individuals, healthcare professionals, 
and researchers alike. With early detection and proactive intervention, we can improve healthcare outcomes and contribute to a healthier society.

Future Work:
In the future, I aim to expand the range of diseases covered by the web app, incorporating additional prediction models for different medical conditions.
I also plan to enhance the accuracy and performance of the existing models through continuous refinement and updates. Additionally, incorporating additional features, 
such as data visualization and personalized recommendations, will further enhance the user experience and provide even greater value to users.
